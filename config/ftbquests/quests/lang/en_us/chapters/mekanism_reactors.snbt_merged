		"Using some vanilla mechanics and 2 &aFission Reactor Logic Adapters&r, we can create a simple circuit breaker to trip and turn off the reactor &o&ein case things get a little crazy&r.\\n\\nTo do this, we'll need a single piece of Redstone, a Piston, a block of either sand or gravel, and an Observer.\\n\\nOn one of the faces, we'll want to put a Logic Adapter down, then skip a block above it and then place another Adapter. Set the top Adapter to \"&9Activation&r\", and the bottom Adapter to \"&cDamage Critical&r\".\\n\\nNext, in front and underneath the bottom Adapter, place any building block and stick a piece of Redstone on it leading from the Adapter. We'll then place a Piston facing up in front of that Redstone, then place our piece of sand or gravel on that Piston.\\n\\nFor the final part of our breaker, place the Observer with the face pointing &boutwards towards the Piston setup&r. &9This is important&r!\\n\\nWhenever the Reactor has critical damage, it will then activate the bottom Adapter, causing the redstone to get a signal, which then activates the Piston and pushes up the Gravel/Sand. This will activate the Observer, which then turns off the Reactor.\\n"
